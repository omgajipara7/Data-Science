# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier – Data Science Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** using `scikit-learn`. The objective was to gain practical experience with tree-based models, preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation metrics as part of a hands-on data science session conducted on my dataset.
