# 🎓 Student Placement Prediction using Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

This project applies a **Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)** classification model to predict whether a student will be placed based on their **CGPA** and **IQ**.

---

## 📊 Overview

- **Goal:** Predict placement using CGPA & IQ.
- **Model Used:** Gaussian Naive Bayes (`GaussianNB`)
- **Accuracy:** ✅ 100%
- **Visualization:** Decision boundary using `mlxtend.plotting.plot_decision_regions`

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Columns:
  - `cgpa`: Student's CGPA
  - `iq`: Student's IQ level
  - `placement`: 0 or 1 indicating placement status

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Trained using `scikit-learn`'s GaussianNB model.
- Explored data with scatter plots, KDE plots, and boxplots.
- Found best random state for high model accuracy.
- Visualized decision boundaries using `mlxtend`.
- Saved classification boundary as `NaiveBayesGaussianNB.jpg`.
