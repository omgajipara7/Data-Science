# 📈 Regression

Regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict continuous values based on input data. It finds the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).

## 🎯 Goal
To find a function `f(x)` that best approximates the target `y`.

## 🧠 Common Types of Regression

| Type               | Description                                     | Use Case Example                       |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression  | Fits a straight line to the data                 | Predicting house prices                |
| Polynomial         | Fits a curve using polynomial equations          | Modeling complex relationships         |
| Ridge Regression   | Linear model with L2 regularization              | Preventing overfitting                 |
| Lasso Regression   | Linear model with L1 regularization              | Feature selection + regularization     |
| ElasticNet         | Combination of L1 + L2 penalties                 | Balanced regularization                |
