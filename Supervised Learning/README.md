# 🤖 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. The algorithm learns from the input-output pairs and tries to map the inputs to correct outputs.

## ✅ Applications
- Stock price prediction
- Spam detection
- Image classification
- Credit scoring

## 🔍 Categories

### 1. Regression
Used when the output is a **continuous value** (e.g., predicting prices, temperature, etc.)

### 2. Classification
Used when the output is a **categorical label** (e.g., spam or not spam, disease or no disease)
